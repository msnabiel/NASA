### Explanation

> What would it look like to plunge into a monster black hole?  This image from a supercomputer visualization shows the entire sky as seen from a simulated camera plunging toward a 4-million-solar-mass black hole, similar to the one at the center of our galaxy.  The camera lies about 16 million kilometers from the black hole’s event horizon and is moving inward at 62% the speed of light.  Thanks to gravity’s funhouse effects, the starry band of the Milky Way appears both as a compact loop at the top of this view and as a secondary image stretching across the bottom.  Move the cursor over the image for additional explanations.  Visualizations like this allow astronomers to explore black holes in ways not otherwise possible.
